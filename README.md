# What is TestNode?
<p>Testnode is a mobile application that makes the process of getting tested for Covid-19 more efficient by filling in personal information to send to the testing centers.</p>

<p> TestNode is for anyone going through the process of getting testing for the coronavirus and in need of a single app to organize everything the testing center needs from them. 

The language I chose to program Testnode is Swift using Xcode.

When you start the app up, it brings to the menu, where there is a list of forms needed to fill out, prescreening, check in, and check out.

Before going to the center to get tested, the user must fill out the prescreening form which I found on the New Hampshire Homeland Security and emergency Management resource center website.
